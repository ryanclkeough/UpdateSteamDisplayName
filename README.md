# UpdateSteamName
Edit 1/27/24: I was streaming this to some friends, and my buddy John informed me that Steam has the ability to clear out all previous aliases associated with an account by just clicking 1 button. The intention of this project was to remove all previous aliases to hide previous names from steam friends. With this button, the script doesn't really serve a practical purpose to me. I will keep the old code here incase I want to come back and either pivot the scope of the project or re-use the code. But this project is unfortunately going to be shut down. Thank you

# Project Description
Update your steam name to whatever new name you would like, without needing to navigate to the location necessary to update it. My goal is to also have it keep a json file that contains your last used name incase you want to fast swap between the 2

1. Make sure you have the correct browser installed on your computer. If not, update what browser is being opened
2. Make sure you are already logged into Steam in your chosen browser, or else the script will not be able to navigate to the correct location
3. If the tab looping seems to be undershooting or overshooting, you may need to tweak the tab amounts to fit your profile
