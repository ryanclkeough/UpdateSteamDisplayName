# UpdateSteamName
Edit 1/27/24: I was streaming this to some friends, and my buddy John informed me that Steam has the ability to clear out all previous aliases associated with an account. Because of this incredibly easy option, the original purpose of this script has been lost on me. I will keep the dummy code here incase I want to come back, but this project is unfortunately going to be shut down. Thank you

Update your steam name to whatever new name you would like, without needing to navigate to the location necessary to update it. My goal is to also have it keep a json file that contains your last used name incase you want to fast swap between the 2

1. Make sure you have the correct browser installed on your computer. If not, update what browser is being opened
2. Make sure you are already logged into Steam in your chosen browser, or else the script will not be able to navigate to the correct location
